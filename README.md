# Leetcode-150
# Algorithms and Data Structures (DSA)

This repository contains implementations of various algorithms and data structures in different programming languages. It serves as a resource for learning and understanding fundamental concepts in computer science.

## Introduction

Algorithms and data structures are essential components of computer science and software development. Understanding these concepts is crucial for building efficient and scalable software solutions. This repository aims to provide implementations of commonly used algorithms and data structures along with explanations to help developers grasp these concepts.

## Languages

The implementations are available in multiple programming languages, including but not limited to:

- [Python](./python)
- [Java](./java)

Choose a language directory to explore the implementations in that language.

## Contents

The repository includes implementations of various algorithms and data structures, organized by language. Some of the commonly implemented algorithms and data structures include:

- Sorting Algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort)
- Searching Algorithms (e.g., Binary Search)
- Graph Algorithms (e.g., Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search)
- Data Structures (e.g., Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Hash Tables)

Feel free to explore the directories and files to learn more about each implementation.
